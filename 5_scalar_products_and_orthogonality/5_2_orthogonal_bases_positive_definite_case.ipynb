    "### Theorem 2.1\n",

    "Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space, with a positive definite scalar product. Let $W$ be a subspace of $V$, and let $\\{w_1, ... ,w_m\\}$ be an orthogonal basis of $W$ If $W \\neq V$, then there exist elements $w_{m+1}, ..., w_n$ of $V$ such that $\\{w_1, ..., w_n\\}$ is an orthogonal basis of $V$.\n",

    "#### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "The method of proof is as important as the theorem, and is called the **Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $W$ is a subspace of $V$, then its $w_1, ..., w_m$ are also linear independent vectors in $V$.\n",

    "And since $W \\neq V$, by [corollary 3.5 in chapter 1.3](1_vector_spaces/1_vector_spaces.ipynb#Corollary-3.5.), we have $\\dim W \\leq \\dim V$. Thus $m \\leq n$.\n",
