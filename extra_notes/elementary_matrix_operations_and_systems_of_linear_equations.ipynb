    "## The lack computation aspects in Lang's book\n",
    "\n",
    "Lang's book does not cover Gaussian Elimination, and the computation aspects builds around it. One consequence of that, is the readers of the book may rapidly develop the ability to tell how many solutions does a system of the linear equations have, but not being able to actually solve it as easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "This note aims to fill that gap of the book. It mainly follows the chapter 3 of [Friedberg's book](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Friedberg-Linear-Algebra-4th-Edition/PGM252241.html). It is also inspired by [Pinkham's commentary](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~pinkham/LangCommentary.pdf) on Lang's book."
