They are both just polynomials in one variable, it's just the choice of variable is different in the two [rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)#Definition).\n",

    "When $T: V \\to W$ is an isomorphism, we’ll write $T: V \\xrightarrow{\\sim} W$ if we want to emphasize that it is an isomorphism. When $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic, but the specific isomorphism is not named, we’ll just write $V \\cong W$.\n",
